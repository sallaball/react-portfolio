                        I am about to receive a bootcamp certificate in full stack development from Southern Methodist University.
                        I am looking to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. I have newly developed skills in in JavaScrtipt, 
                        CSS, HTML, React.js, as well as others to achieve this goal. I am a good problem solver and a fast learner.
                    </p>
                </div>
        </section>
    );
}

export default About;
